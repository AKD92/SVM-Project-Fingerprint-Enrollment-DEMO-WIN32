# SVM-Voter-Fingerprint-Enrollment-DEMO-WIN32
A Demonstration of Fingerprint Enrollment mechanism for Voters in WIN32 API. This is a simple demo 'Host' application which uses Serial POrt for communicating with the ArduinoMEGA2560 MCU. The MEGA2560 MCU contains the GT511C3 Figerprint Driver Software specially designed for SVM project (see my previous project at GitHub).
