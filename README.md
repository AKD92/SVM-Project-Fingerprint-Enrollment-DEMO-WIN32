# SVM-Voter-Fingerprint-Enrollment-DEMO-WIN32
A Demonstration of Fingerprint Enrollment mechanism for Voters in WIN32 API. This is a simple demo 'Host' application which uses Serial POrt for communicating with the ArduinoMEGA2560 MCU. The MEGA2560 MCU contains the GT511C3 Figerprint Driver Software specially designed for SVM project (<a href="https://github.com/AKD92/GT511C3-Fingerprint-Driver-For-SVM-Atmel2560_MCU">GT511C3 Driver Software for SVM + MEGA2560</a>).
